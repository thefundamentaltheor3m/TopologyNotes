name: organize
description: Refactor the chapter, section and subsection structure of these lecture notes so that what is already written sits where it belongs, and maintain TOPICS.md as the record of that structure. Use when the notes have outgrown or drifted from their current arrangement — a section doing the work of three, a chapter whose title no longer describes its contents, material in the wrong place, a heading level that should not exist — or when TOPICS.md needs rebuilding. Triggers on "/organize", "organize the notes", "reorganize the chapters", "restructure this", "sort out TOPICS.md". Not for absorbing a new lecture: that is /integrate.

# Organizing the notes

There is no syllabus for this course. The structure of `Chapters/` was therefore
never designed — it accreted, one lecture at a time, and every lecture was placed
using only the information available before the next one happened. This skill is the
correction pass: it takes the notes as they stand and rearranges *them*, adding
nothing and removing nothing.

Read these first, in order:

- `.claude/ORGANIZATION.md` — what earns a chapter, a section and a subsection, the
  naming conventions, and the format and ownership of `TOPICS.md`. **This skill's job
  is to make the document match that file** — which means matching its account of the
  generality ladder, not its size table.
- `CLAUDE.md` — build commands, preamble layout, authoring conventions.
- `.claude/STYLE.md` — the voice, for the connecting prose that restructuring
  inevitably needs rewritten.

## Scope: what this skill is and is not

`/organize` and `/integrate` share their format, their guiding principles and their
respect for the author's mathematics. They do not share a scope, and confusing the
two is the main way either can do damage.

| | `/integrate` | `/organize` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input | one lecture's raw notes | the notes as they already stand |
| Adds material | yes, that is the point | **never** |
| Restructures | only enough to house the new material | yes, that is the point |
| `TOPICS.md` | appends its own entries | **owns the file** |
| Ends with | the raw file dissolved | the same content, better arranged |

**This skill adds no mathematics and no exposition beyond connecting prose.** If you
find yourself writing a definition, finishing a proof, or supplying an example, stop:
that is `/address-comments`, `/fill-sorries`, or a lecture's job, not this one. The
content going in is the content coming out.

**This skill deletes nothing.** Not a duplicate, not a triviality, not a stray aside.
Restructuring that loses a sentence has failed, however much better the outline
looks.

If the notes contain a `Lecture_*.tex` staging file, this skill is the wrong one —
that file is `/integrate`'s. Say so and stop. Running `/organize` first on unintegrated
material would restructure around content that is about to move anyway.

## Procedure

### 1. Take inventory

Before forming any opinion, read the notes and say what is in them. For every
chapter, section and subsection, write down **what idea or line of enquiry it
actually contains** — one sentence, in your own words, of the form "this establishes
X" or "this is the definition of Y and what it is for". If you cannot write that
sentence for a heading, that is your first finding.

Then, for each unit: its title, its file, and whether the sentence you wrote matches
the title. Sizes are worth noting in passing but they decide nothing; see
`ORGANIZATION.md` on how little they are worth.

Also record

- every `\subsubsection` (there should be none — that one is a real rule),
- every heading whose title no longer describes what you just wrote down about it,
- every place where consecutive material is really one idea under two headings, or two
  ideas under one,
- every label, and every `\Cref` that points at one — this is the map of what
  renumbering will break.

Keep the inventory for the rest of the run. Nothing may be dropped, so an
unrecorded item is an item at risk.

### 2. Read the corpus, not just the notes

The standard is the author's other notes, not your instincts about how a textbook
should look. `ORGANIZATION.md` summarizes them, but when a specific call is close —
is this one subsection or two? does this deserve a section? — go and look at how a
comparable piece of material is handled in [TopologyNotes][t], [LogicNotes][l],
[RepTheoryEPFL][r] or [LieAlgebrasNotes][a]. Find the nearest analog and follow it.

[t]: https://github.com/thefundamentaltheor3m/TopologyNotes
[l]: https://github.com/thefundamentaltheor3m/LogicNotes
[r]: https://github.com/thefundamentaltheor3m/RepTheoryEPFL
[a]: https://github.com/thefundamentaltheor3m/LieAlgebrasNotes

Three questions worth asking of the corpus every time:

- **Is this material one idea or several?** That is the subsection test, and the corpus
  is full of worked examples of where the author draws the line — including very short
  subsections (*Ideals*, *Quotients*) kept separate because they are separate ideas.
- **Where is this line of enquiry going?** If you can name the destination, you have a
  section; if the destination is the same as the section it follows, you have a
  subsection of that section.
- **Would the author have given this its own heading?** Look for the nearest analog
  and see whether they did. Do not reason from length — the author does not.

### 3. Diagnose

State what is wrong with the current arrangement, as a list of specific findings,
each argued from the ideas. A finding names the mismatch between what a unit contains
and what its heading claims: "the material in 1.2 asks the same question of a more
general object, so it continues 1.1's line of enquiry rather than starting a new one,
but it currently sits unheaded inside a subsection about the special case". "Section 1.2 is 45
lines, below the corpus median" is not a finding — it is at best a hint that sent you
to look. "The structure could be cleaner" is not a finding either.

Every finding must survive the question **"what would a reader misunderstand?"** If
nothing, there is nothing to fix, whatever the numbers say.

Then say what is *right*, and leave it alone. A correction pass that rewrites
everything it touches is indistinguishable from noise, and the author has to review
every line of it.

Where the notes cannot satisfy the norms at all — early in a course they cannot —
apply the self-healing rule from `ORGANIZATION.md`: favor the arrangement whose
deviations resolve themselves as lectures arrive, and record the deviation in
`TOPICS.md` with the condition that will end it.

### 4. Plan, and get it approved

Produce the plan and **stop for confirmation before moving anything.** The plan
states:

- the target outline, in full, as it will appear in `TOPICS.md`;
- for each move: what content, from where, to where, and which finding it answers;
- every heading created, deleted, promoted or demoted, with its title;
- every file created, renamed or deleted;
- every renumbering the move causes, and every `\Cref` that will need checking;
- the connecting prose to be rewritten, with a sentence on what each passage will
  now have to do — a section that acquires a new neighbor usually needs its opening
  sentence changed;
- anything you have decided to leave alone despite it being off-norm, and why.

Structure is editorial judgment and the author is the editor. Restructuring is also
the most expensive thing to undo in these notes, because it renumbers results. Never
skip this step, even when the diagnosis looks unarguable.

If the run is happening in a context where you cannot stop and ask — an automated
pass, a one-shot request for a finished branch — then say so plainly, apply the
plan, and put the full plan and its rationale in the commit message and the pull
request body instead. What is not acceptable is moving things silently.

### 5. Apply

Working rules, in order of importance:

**Content is invariant.** Every definition, statement, proof, display, figure and
paragraph comes out the other side character-for-character identical, unless it is
connecting prose. Move by cutting and pasting whole blocks; do not retype, do not
"tidy while moving". If a passage seems wrong, leave it wrong and report it.

**Rewrite connecting tissue freely, and only that.** Section and subsection titles,
opening and closing sentences, the one-sentence bridges that carry the reader between
environments, chapter intro prose. These are what make a rearrangement read as though
it had always been that way, and rewriting them is the whole point. `STYLE.md` has
the voice.

**Move whole ideas.** Do not split a definition from the example that motivates it,
or a theorem from its proof, across a heading boundary. If a section boundary would
land in the middle of an argument, the boundary is in the wrong place.

**Preserve labels wherever possible.** A label's `Ch<N>:` prefix should match its new
chapter, so a cross-chapter move means renaming labels and updating every `\Cref` to
them. A same-chapter move should leave labels untouched — renaming a label nobody
asked you to rename is churn that shows up in the diff and helps nobody.

**File and directory names follow the content.** A section that moves to slot 1.3
becomes `1_3_<Abbrev>.tex`, and its `\input` moves with it. Use `git mv` so the
rename is visible in the diff rather than appearing as a delete plus an add. Quote
paths: some directory names contain spaces. Chapter 1's directory stays `1_Intro`
regardless of the chapter's title — see `ORGANIZATION.md`.

**No subsubsections, ever.** If the plan wanted one, the section above it was wrong.

**Placeholders left over from the template** are in scope for this skill in a way
they are not for `/integrate`, since they are a structural problem. In a fresh
repository that is everything under `Chapters/`: `0_Overview.tex`,
`1_Intro/1_1_Imp_Defs.tex`, `1_Intro/1_2_Another_Section.tex`, `2_Another Chapter/`
and `Appendices/`. Propose clearing them as real material displaces them, recording in
`TOPICS.md` what went and why; never clear a file that has acquired real content.
`Chapters/Appendices/` is worth keeping longest — three of the four sibling
repositories keep one, two of those with the `\input` still commented out.

### 6. Rebuild TOPICS.md

`/organize` owns this file; rewrite it to describe the new structure, in the format
`ORGANIZATION.md` specifies. In particular:

- the leading inference note about where the structure looks to be heading, marked as
  inference and left open for the next run to disagree with;
- every line traceable to a lecture, with its date;
- `## Signposted` kept separate from the outline, so a topic a lecture merely pointed
  at cannot harden into a section nobody asked for;
- any deliberate deviation from the norms, with the condition that will end it.

### 7. Verify

1. **Inventory check** — walk the inventory and name the file and heading each item
   now sits under. Anything unaccounted for is a bug; find it before continuing.
2. **Content diff** — `git diff` and confirm that every changed line of mathematics
   is a pure move. `git diff --stat` should show a lot of renames and few
   modifications outside titles and bridging prose. This is the check that catches
   the failure mode of this skill, which is rewriting while rearranging.
3. **Build** — `latexmk -pdf -outdir=TeX_Outputs main.tex`. Read the log for
   undefined references and duplicate labels: those are the symptoms of a botched
   move. Grep for `\Cref`s to anything that moved.
4. **Numbering** — check the rendered ToC against the outline in `TOPICS.md`, and
   spot-check that results renumbered the way the plan said they would.
5. **Refresh `TeX_Outputs/main.pdf`** — it is tracked deliberately.

### 8. Branch, commit, PR

Never restructure directly on `main`.

```bash
git checkout -b organize/<short-description>
git add -A && git commit    # subject: "Reorganize <what>"
git push -u origin organize/<short-description>
```

Then attempt the PR — `gh` is on some of the author's machines and not others, so
check rather than assume:

```bash
gh auth status
gh pr create --base main --title "Reorganize <what>" --body-file <file>
```

Write the body to a file so it survives shell quoting, and put the diagnosis and the
plan in it: for a restructuring PR, the rationale *is* the reviewable content, since
the diff is mostly moves. Follow the build with `gh pr checks --watch`; a red build
on `main` breaks the published PDF. If `gh` is unavailable, say so and print the
compare URL instead:

```
https://github.com/thefundamentaltheor3m/TopologyNotes/compare/main...organize/<short-description>
```

## Report back

- **The diagnosis**: each finding, argued from what the material is about and what a
  reader would otherwise misunderstand.
- **The moves**: what went where, and which finding each one answers.
- **What was left alone**, including anything off-norm you decided to tolerate and
  the condition that would change your mind.
- **Renumbering**: what changed number, and every `\Cref` you checked.
- **Prose you rewrote** — titles, bridges, intros. These are the only places where
  words changed, so they are what the author needs to read.
- **Anything you think is wrong** in the notes, quoted, left unchanged.
  That list is the input to `/check-correctness`, which is the skill that acts on it.
- The build result.

Be specific about the prose. In a restructuring pass the moves are mechanical and
verifiable, but the rewritten sentences are yours, and they are the part the author
cannot check from the outline alone.
