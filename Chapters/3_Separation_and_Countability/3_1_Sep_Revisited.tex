\section{(More) Separation Properties}

Now where were we...
\begin{itemize}
    \item $T_0$: Given any $x,y\in X$, either there exists some open $U$ with $x\in U$, $y\notin U$.
    \item $T_1$: Singleton sets (not ``points'' ``because this is a picky and pedantic discipline'') are closed.
    \item $T_2$: Hausdorff!
    
\end{itemize}

It is now time to prepare ourselves for the metrization theorems to come. One may notice that the following has a slightly different flavour than our previous separation properties:
\begin{boxdefinition}[Regular Space]
    $X$ a space is ``regular'' if for all $x\in X$, $C\ssq X$ with $C$ closed and $x\notin C$, there are open $U$ with $x\in U$ and $V\supseteq C$ such that $U\cap V=\emptyset$.
\end{boxdefinition}
\begin{boxdefinition}[Normal Space]
    We say that our space $X$ is ``normal'' if for all closed $C,D\ssq X$ with $C\cap D=\emptyset$, then there are $U\supseteq C, V\supseteq D$ with $U,V$ open subsets of $X$ such that $U\cap V=\emptyset$.
\end{boxdefinition}
\begin{boxdefinition}[Completely Regular Space]
    Our favorite and least favorite space $X$ is ``completely regular'' if for all $x\in X, C\ssq X$ closed with $x\notin C$, there is a continuous $f:X\rightarrow [0,1]$ such that $f(x)=0, f[c]=[1]$.
\end{boxdefinition}
\begin{remark}
    Getting to the idea of separating sets with continuous functions - will be discussed much more after fall break...
\end{remark}
\begin{remark}
    Note also that we do NOT require that ``regular'', ``normal'', or ``completely regular'' spaces are Hausdorff.
\end{remark}
[also note that we had lots of $T$ but I spent too long typing and did not have the time to grab any before it was removed from the board :( \sorry]
% T4 is Hausdorff + Normal

\begin{boxdefinition}[$T_3$ Space]
    A topological space is \textbf{$T_4$} if it is Hausdorff and regular.
\end{boxdefinition}

\begin{boxdefinition}[$T_4$ Space]
    A topological space is \textbf{$T_4$} if it is Hausdorff and normal.
\end{boxdefinition}

\begin{boxdefinition}[$T_{3.5}$/Tychonoff Space]\label{Ch3:Def:T3.5}
    A topological space is \textbf{$T_{3.5}$} or \textbf{Tychonoff} if it is Hausdorff and completely regular.
\end{boxdefinition}

We can offer another characterisation of Tychonoff spaces.

% \begin{boxlemma}
%     A topological space $X$ is Tychonoff if and only if 
% \end{boxlemma}
