\chapter{More Topological Properties}

In this chapter, we dive deeper into properties of topological spaces. Specifically, we will focus on how properties are propagated by subspaces and constructions, such as products and quotients.

% Organisational idea: make this a short chapter called 'More Point-Set Topology' or something, and then create a new chapter for function spaces.
