\chapter{Topologies on Sets of Functions}

In this chapter of the course, we will venture into the wonderfully weird realm of function spaces and functional analysis. We will talk about Hilbert spaces, operators on Hilbert spaces, and topologies on spaces of operators on Hilbert spaces.

If you look at the Wikipedia page on topologies on spaces of operators on Hilbert spaces, there are about 10 different topologies mentioned. So this is quite a rich theory, and we will explore it in detail.

We begin with set-theoretic notation (which we really should've introduced earlier---unless we have---because we've kinda been using it all along...).

\begin{boxnotation}
    For sets $X$ and $Y$, denote $Y^X := X \to Y$, the set of functions from $X$ to $Y$.
\end{boxnotation}

We begin with some motivations and first examples.
