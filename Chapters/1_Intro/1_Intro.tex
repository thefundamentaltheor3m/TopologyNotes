We begin by making a few slightly non-standard notational choices.

\begin{boxnotation}
    Given a function $f : X \to Y$ and a subset $A \subseteq X$, we write
    \begin{align*}
        f[A] := \setst{f(x) \in Y}{x \in A}
    \end{align*}
    In similar fashion, given $B \subseteq Y$, we write
    \begin{align*}
        f\inv[B] := \setst{x \in X}{f(x) \in B}
    \end{align*}
\end{boxnotation}

The reason it is important to distinguish between the notations $f(A)$ and $f[A]$ is that there might be a situation in which $A \in X$ \textit{and} $A \subseteq X$. % This is as clear an indication as any that the lecturer is a set theorist.
We will not make any more notational choices at this stage that differ from standard mathematical conventions. As and when we do, we will introduce them.

We now recall basic facts about metric spaces.
