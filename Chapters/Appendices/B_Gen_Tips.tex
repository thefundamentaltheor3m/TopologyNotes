\section{Professor Cummings's Top(ological) Tips}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Follow your nose!
    \item Proof by picture always works!
    \item The surface of this blackboard is a \textit{super} pleasant topological space - it is a closed subset of $\R^2$!
    \item Sometimes, pictures can be helpful; sometimes, they can be totally misleading. The more sets there are, the worse the pictures become...
    \item You should always check what you want to do in your heart, but you should also check that what you want to do in your heart works.
    \item Just figure it out.
    \item Pictures can be seductively useful...
    \item In a topological setting, you often don't really care too much about boundedness.
    \item You really want to read the fine print when I'm defining these metrics and topologies...
    \item It's kind of an interesting situation when a compact set lives inside an open set.
    \item What is a pointed space? It means you've got a space and a point.
\end{enumerate}
