\section{A Categorical Perspective}

\subsection{Product Spaces}
\label{APP:Subsec:Products}

% Insights we should include:
% 1. The product objects are Cartesian products endowed with the product topology, not with the box topology. This is because we want topologies to be small to have continuous functions going into them, and the universal property of products involves functions going into products (products being the universal limit cone of points).
% 2. The equaliser of the projection maps from X \times X to X is the diagonal.
